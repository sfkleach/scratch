# My Project

This is a description of my project. Below is a tree diagram created using Mermaid:

```mermaid

mindmap

      subsub2((Subnode 1.2))
    sub2((Subnode 2))
      subsub3((Subnode 2.1))

## Welcome to Old GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sfkleach/scratch/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

(Causing rebase to be non-trivial. Now hack this - for squashing. Hacked again for reviewing the remote repo extension from Microsoft.)

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sfkleach/scratch/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
